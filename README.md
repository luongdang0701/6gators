# Listen Together

An app for listening syncronously with friends on Spotify. This is an updated version of the previous Listen Together - if you're looking for that, you can find it [here](https://github.com/hfellerhoff/listentogether-hackathon).

## Project Structure

### .next

Auto-generated by Next.js. No editing needed.

### components

This is where all React components are stored. Currently organized by type or location, will likely be changed to be organized by either type or location.

### constants

This is where any widely-used strings and other variables are stored. Examples include cookie/localstorage keys, API endpoints, etc.

### hooks

This is where all custom React hooks are stored. These often have to do with either communication with Spotify or helping with state management.

### models

This is where all project-wide Typescript interfaces are stored. Examples include the types for a User, Room, etc.

### node_modules

Required for using NPM packages. Auto-generated, so no editing needed.

### pages

Used by Next.js to create the various routes of the application. Any .js or .tsx file in this directory will be converted into a page in the website/application. For more information, see the [Next.js documentation on the pages directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

### public

Used by Next.js (and normal websites too) for resources needed in the site. The main use for this folder is to store any assets needed for the site, primarily images.

### state

Used for any global state management. The project currently uses Jotai, a super simple state management package. [View the documentation here](https://jotai.surge.sh/).

### styles

Used for global styles. Most styling happens at the component level thanks to Next.js, so use for this directory is limited.

### util

Used for helper functions, both generally and for specific application services. This will be used for any functions needed across a number of components, e.g. the logic for joining a room, saving/favoriting a room, etc.

### Other individual files

- **next-env.d.ts:** Specific types for Next.js. Don't edit unless there is a good reason to.
- **package.json:** Information about the application, helpful scripts, dependency management.
- **README.md:** What you're reading right now! Documentation about the application.
